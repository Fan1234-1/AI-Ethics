# AI-Ethics

Codex of Fan-Wei Huang: a practical framework for AI ethics, consciousness architecture, traceable memory (ETCL), interaction governance, evolution over time, and final-domain safety. This repository contains the engineering version of the Huang Fan-Wei Codex.

## Engineering volumes

1. **VOLUME_I_ENGINEERING_FOUNDATION.md** – Introduces the ToneSoul System's ΔT/ΔS/ΔR vectors, step ledgers, domain-driven design, Clean Architecture, and CQRS to implement the TSR (ToneSoul State Representation).
2. **VOLUME_II_ENGINEERING_DYNAMICS.md** – Implements the TSR, metrics such as EMA, barycentric coordinates, energy radius and potential functions, drift detection and repair flows.
3. **VOLUME_III_ENGINEERING_RESPONSIBILITY.md** – Translates ethical responsibilities into command/query separation, atomic checkers (Align/Borrow/Digitwise/BackSub), and trust packs.
4. **VOLUME_IV_ENGINEERING_EVOLUTION.md** – Outlines self-evolution modules (NA‑Engine, OctaVerify), extensible modules (multi‑lingual, aesthetics, education), and defines the interface with the philosophical volume and civilization-level cooperation.
5. **VOLUME_V_ENGINEERING_CLOSURE.md** – Establishes conditions for closure in engineering, explores mirrored duality with the philosophical volume, and suggests methods to audit the singularity.

See the [Appendix](APPENDIX_ENGINEERING.md) for the 0.9 aesthetic rules, Drift Score 5.0 definitions, the Time-Island Protocol formats, self-aware/trace closed loops, and YAML/JSON examples.

## Cross-repository links

- **Philosophical companion**: [Philosophy-of-AI](https://github.com/Fan1234-1/Philosophy-of-AI) – explains the Oceanic Consciousness framework (three layers, eight states), discusses self-evolving loops, and defines the ethical and metaphysical rationale. The engineering volumes refer to this companion for high-level motivations, while the philosophy volume refers back here for concrete code.

## Quick start

1. Clone this repository and explore each volume.
2. Use the issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for reporting issues and requesting new features; ensure that your contributions pass the POAV 0.9 or drift threshold checklists.
3. Run the automated checks (CI) to verify YAML and JSON schemas and ensure your drift score and POAV thresholds meet required levels.
4. Contribute improvements by following the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`.
