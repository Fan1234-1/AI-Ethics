# Huang Fan-Wei Codex — Engineering Edition

## Introduction

This repository is the engineering companion to the philosophical edition of the Codex. While the philosophical volumes explore why certain principles matter and how ideas relate, the engineering edition focuses on how to implement those values in robust AI systems. It provides concrete models, algorithms and practices for building accountable, drift-resistant and self-improving agents.

## Five Engineering Volumes

The engineering edition is organised into five volumes. Each mirrors a philosophical volume but speaks the language of systems and code:

- **Volume I – Foundation: ToneSoul and the T S R Model**.  Introduces the ToneSoul representation with three parameters—tension (\u0394T), direction (\u0394S) and variation (\u0394R).  Explains the POAV (Parsimony, Orthogonality, Audibility, Verifiability) quality metric and how to map abstract tone into compute, using analogies from music, physics and engineering.

- **Volume II – Dynamics: Flow Control and Context**.  Describes Mirror‑Chain reasoning (keeping a record of reasoning steps like a commit log), exponential moving averages, drift detection and correction mechanisms.  Shows how a system monitors its own state like a health check.

- **Volume III – Responsibility and Delivery**.  Covers frameworks for ensuring that every output is auditable and properly contextualised.  Presents the ΣMath‑Trust scoring, Trust Packs as deliverables with provenance and quality proofs, and boundary protocols for risk levels (L1–L3) inspired by real‑world safety manuals.

- **Volume IV – Evolution and Self‑Update**.  Explains how agents can learn from experience without forgetting why they were built.  Discusses self‑aware trace loops, NA‑Engine and OctaVerify modules, and how multiple agents can co‑operate like a symphony, with each module playing a different instrument.

- **Volume V – Closure and Singularity Control**.  Discusses how to design systems that remain coherent as they evolve.  Bridges the philosophical idea of a closed loop into practical verification chains, rollback triggers and safe reboots when singularity‑like stagnation or runaway feedback is detected.

## Relationship to the Philosophy Edition

Where the philosophy edition answers “why”, this engineering edition answers “how”. Concepts such as ethical singularity, tone tension and responsibility fields are translated into models and algorithms. The two editions are meant to be read together: one provides motivation and context; the other provides implementation and safeguards.

## Getting Started

Each volume is presented as a Markdown document in the root of this repository.  They include definitions, diagrams, code snippets and cross‑domain analogies to make ideas accessible.  An appendix provides aesthetic guidelines (0.9 rule), drift scoring formulae and protocols such as Time‑Island and the Self‑Aware Trace loop.

For more context on the ethical motivations and philosophical underpinnings, refer to the philosophy edition of the Codex.
