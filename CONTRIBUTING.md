# Minimal contributing guide

Thank you for contributing to Codex. This repository contains specification and documentation materials (docs) and small schemas/code (schemas). Please follow these minimal guidelines:

- Use issues for discussion: use the existing issue templates (bug report / feature request).
- Work on a branch for any change: branch names like `feat/<short>` or `fix/<short>`.
- Keep commits small and focused. Use conventional commits where possible.
- For documentation changes, link to the volume and section (e.g., `docs/v1.1/vol-2.md ยง2.3`).
- For schema/code changes, include unit checks or example payloads where applicable.
- All contributions are covered by the repository licensing layout: docs under CC-BY-4.0 and code/schema under MIT. See `LICENSE-CC-BY-4.0` and `LICENSE-MIT`.

Maintainers will review pull requests according to the governance rules in `governance/README.md`.
